Morphonets is an open, community-driven effort to provide ImageJ-based tools for generation, visualization, quantification, and modeling of neuroanatomical data. The tools we create are leveraged by the powerful stack of ImageJ2-based software.
Currently, the focus is cellular neuroscience, but the tools we developed have been successfully applied to other fields of the biosciences. The following projects are being developed under the Morphonets umbrella:

- [SNT](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT): The successor of the Simple Neurite Tracer Plugin ??
- [SciView-Cx3D](https://github.com/morphonets/cx3d): The modernized Cx3D ??? Kyle can you add something here
- Scripts
- Anything else

# Getting Started:
Have a look at SNT [documentation](https://imagej.net/SNT), the manuscript, the gallery of images(), the gallery of scripts,
# Getting Involved: 
Contact us on [GitHub](https://github.com/morphonets) or the image.sc forum
