<h1 align="center">Welcome To Morphonets!</h1>


Morphonets is an open, community-driven effort to provide [ImageJ](https://imagej.net)-based tools for generation, visualization, quantification, and modeling of neuroanatomical data. The tools we create are leveraged by the powerful stack of [Scijava](https://scijava.org)-based software.
Our immediate focus is cellular neuroscience, but the software we develop has been successfully applied to other areas of the biosciences. 



## Projects
Currently, two major projects are being developed under the Morphonets umbrella:

- [SNT](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT): A complete framework for semi-automated tracing and analysis of neurons ([user-based documentation](https://imagej.net/SNT)).
- [SciView-Cx3D](https://github.com/morphonets/cx3d): A image-based modeling framework powered by Cx3D and [SciView](https://github.com/scenerygraphics/sciview)  ([user-based documentation](https://imagej.net/SNT:_Modeling)).



## Downloads
All projects are available in [Fiji](https://imagej.net/Fiji) by means of two [update sites](https://imagej.net/Update_Sites): *Neuroanatomy* and *SciView*:

1.  Run the Fiji Updater (*Help â€º Update...*, the penultimate entry in Fiji's *Help>* menu)
2.  Click *Manage update sites*
3.  Select the *Neuroanatomy* and *SciView* checkboxes
4.  Click *Apply changes* and Restart
